# Data-Driven-Dual-Level-Neural-Network-Tool-for-Dynamic-System-Modeling-D3NN

## Introduction

Data-Driven Dual Level Neural Network (D3NN) is a powerful MATLAB toolkit designed for dynamic system modeling using advanced neural network techniques. This tool integrates data-driven methodologies with a dual-level neural network structure including low-level neural hybrid systems and high-level transition system abstraction to provide accurate and efficient modeling capabilities for various dynamic systems. 

## Features

- **Data-Driven Approach:** Utilizes data to model dynamic systems, ensuring accuracy and relevance.
- **Low-level Neural Hybrid System Modeling:** Low-level neural hybrid system modeling process allows multiple ELMs to be trained and verified. Compared with conventional NN learning, this structure promotes computationally efficiency while maintaining accuracy in dynamics learning.  
- **High-level Transition System Abstraction:**  Based on the low-level neural hybrid system model, the high-level transition system abstraction allows fast and CTL language-based verification, which not only reveals the transitions inside the black-box model but also allows user-friendly language input verification. 

## Installation

To install D3NN, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone or download the D3NN repository.

2. Add the D3NN folder to your MATLAB path.
- **Open MATLAB and navigate to the D3NN folder.**
- **Right-click on the folder in MATLAB's "Current Folder" window.**
- **Select "Add to Path" > "Selected Folders and Subfolders".**
